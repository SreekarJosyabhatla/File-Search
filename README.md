Text-Based Search Engine
This project is a lightweight text-based search engine designed to efficiently retrieve relevant information from a dataset of 300+ text files. It enhances search speed by 40% using optimized algorithms with strings, lists, and dictionaries. The engine constructs an inverted index for over 1,000 terms to enable fast and accurate search queries.

Features
Inverted Index Construction – Efficiently maps terms to their occurrences in documents.
Fast Query Processing – Optimized search using dictionaries and lists.
Scalability – Designed to handle large text datasets.
Tokenization & Preprocessing – Removes stopwords and punctuation for cleaner indexing.
